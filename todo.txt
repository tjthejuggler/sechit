i think things can be way simplified, the only real rotating turn is the president nominations,
 i think we can just have the one loop and then ask for bot/human input as needed

assign a player # to G or randomly pick the first player of the game and make G always be player 1

the vote turn type can be removed since it happens simultaneously
bot voting needs added

input vote result needs to be added to human nomination
bot needs to be asked to vote for human nomination

questions:
what is differnce chatgpt turbo and 301?


thoughts:
only contact G when it needs to make a decision







make a new file that holds the initial prompt, load that into the main loop
maybe make something special if the bot is player 1
