do checks with gpt3 and clean up the responses it says

bot should always tell results of investigation_result

we should be able to input player names at startup so that the bot always refers to people by name


add token counter (it is already in tail/storytell)
    
    #when the bot invesigates it should probably tell people if they are fascist or liberal
    #a place to put in a short description about the player would be nice to give them some character and variety
    #when text mentions the bot it should say which bot it is

MULTIPLE BOTS FEATURES
    TALKING
    right now voice is random, but we dont want to repeat the voices

    TESTING
    major testing needed for multiple bots

POSSIBLE BUGS
bot won, player three was hitler, but game didnt end

maybe a label on the 1st conversation box that shows the last event to have happened

RANDOM TALKING
make randomizer to limit random bot interjections on events

CLEAN
move some stuff from main into other files to clean up code

HUMAN TALK
    there can be player question limits so that each person gets a certain number of interactions

BOT PERSONNESS:        
    bot could randomly choose its name and a short bio, and introduce itself

    a seperate instance can be used to turn player numbers into appropriate phrasing
        this can be used to make the bot more human like and have it seem more like whatever character it is

    is there a way that the bot could have a face with a mouth that moves to the words? 
        the face could be randomly generated

    we can use stable diffusion and various amounts of mouth openness somehow programatically

bot should tell user to show cards?

figure out a way to make a testbench for this

NEEDS TESTED:
    all powers
    game history creation at end of game

SPEAKING VIDEO:
    https://youtu.be/Ic0TBhfuOrA - the colab given here worked well, i imagine that with a decent computer it will be fast enough to do locally

HISTORY SAVING:
    keep a running token size for the game summary
    keep track of token sent/received count for entire game

BOT TALK:
    everything that goes through make_bot_response() could be ran through a seperate instance of gpt with the information about the bot to make it more realistic

RANDOM BOT COMMENT:
    there can be a game variable that is bot_can_make_random_comment
        set to false if it already randomly commented
        set to false if someone else initiated conversation

BOT DECISIONS
    instead of immediately asking the bot for an official response, it could first be asked who it is thinking about investigating/executing to allow players to try to pursuade the bot to change its mind.
        this could also be on a randomizer, so sometimes it listens to people pursuading it.
            instead of a randomizer it could be asked if it wants to make a decision or listen to people pursuading it

MULTIPLE KEYBOARDS
try keyboard_test.py once I have multiple keyboards



MIC COMMUNICATION
    if someone mentions the name of the bot, then the bot will respond to that person
    
    what if we transcribe everything, pick out the words that are most common and feed those to the bot, what if we transcribe everything, pick out the words that are most common and feed those to the bot, 
    
    it responds to its name, which gets detected without him knowing, and causes an event to happen, he gets notified of the event and can respond to it
    also "everyone" should be a name that has a chance of being triggered by.
        this can be done by privately asking hiim if he has anything he would like to stay

    it can be fed a constant feed of what everyone is saying, even if it is too long, it just needs to be told the game state before it makes decisions. In the information it gets, it can be given description of what has been talked about.
    
    there can be a timer setup, after the bot has said something, if anything is said soon enough after then it will go to the bot to respond to again,
    but after enough time has gone by

GAME BOT MAKES SUMMARIES FOR CONVERSATION BOT       
    the game version of the bot makes summaries of the game and the talking bot sees those summaries,
        and vice versa, the talking bot makes summaries of the conversations for their later selves, as well as for the game bot.
    
    how often should summaries be made?

DUAL MINDS (THIS MAY BE A WAY TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM OF PROMPT SIZZES GETTING TOO BIG)
    Maybe: this mode kicks in when the bots tokens excede a certain amount

    the bot could have a dual mind, one that is the game bot, and one that is the talking bot
        whenever the talking bot talks, it should have an up to date summary of the game state

        when the bot plays, it should have a summary of the conversation history

    when the next move happens in the game, summarize the conversation

    the conversation bot should have a summary of the game state before it responds to the player

    when the game bot is called, it should make do decision until it has received a summary of the previous conversation.
