constantly be saving game in case of crash,
    be able to load the previous game when we start

When the bot says something
    have the option to talk to the bot before moving on


a way to override everything and talk directly to the bot with input for special situations
    make an extra option at any input point that allows the user to directly communicate with bot

bot is not allowed to nominate people in the last government(unless there are 5 players, then president can be nominated)
    the bot should be told their options when nominating

keep a running token size for the game summary

keep track of token sent/received count for entire game

must keep track of 3 failed votes

it should ask which player goes first

figure out a way to make a testbench for this

BOT TALK:
when we have been at a cetrain point in the game for awhile, there can be a randomizer that sometimes asks the bot if they want to say something out loud, and tell them how long we have been at this stage. It can tell them to answer yes or no, if they answer yes then it will ask them what they want to say.

when the bot says something that gets printed, it should also be said out loud

stuff that could done by using another instance of gpt should be to save the size of the summary

every time an a game event happens, bot could be asked if it has something it would like to say

instead of immediately asking the bot for an official response, it could first be asked who it is thinking about investigating/executing to allow players to try to pursuade the bot to change its mind.
    this could also be on a randomizer, so sometimes it listens to people pursuading it.
        instead of a randomizer it could be asked if it wants to make a decision or listen to people pursuading it


BOT STRATEGY:
bot should be told that if they are liberal then they should never lie, and if they are facist then they should be deceptive

THOUGHTS:

maybe keep track of all stats and the phrasing used to interact with the bot, and then use tht to improve the bot

instead of giving bot vote results with Y / N , maybe give it results with Yes / No

a seperate instance can be used to turn player numbers into appropriate phrasing
    this can be used to make the bot more human like and have it seem more like whatever character it is




is it possible to text the bot using a telegram bot?
    a wireless microphone that can be passed around to talk to the bot may be better. Ideally there would be a way to tell the bot who is talking to it. The data inputter could just always tell it before someone talks, or it could be on the player to introduce themself.
        For this we need a good voice to text api.

a text to voice api could be used to make the bot talk to the players

make a new file that holds the initial prompt, load that into the main loop
maybe make something special if the bot is player 1
