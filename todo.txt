FIGURE OUT BUG THAT IS KILLING THE CURRENT PRESIDENT

i think things can be way simplified, the only real rotating turn is the president nominations,
 i think we can just have the one loop and then ask for bot/human input as needed

assign a player # to G or randomly pick the first player of the game and make G always be player 1

the vote turn type can be removed since it happens simultaneously
bot voting needs added

input vote result needs to be added to human nomination
bot needs to be asked to vote for human nomination

a way to override everything and talk directly to the bot with input for special situations
    veto needs to be hardcoded or handled like this

bot is not allowed to nominate people in the last government(unless there are 5 players, then president can be nominated)

keep a running token size for the game summary

keep track of token sent/received count for entire game

must keep track of 3 failed votes

instead of giving bot vote results with Y / N , maybe give it results with Yes / No

questions:
what is differnce chatgpt turbo and 301?


thoughts:
only contact G when it needs to make a decision
every time an a game event happens, bot could be asked if it has something it would like to say

bot should be told that if they are liberal then they should never lie, and if they are facist then they should be deceptive

maybe keep track of all stats and the phrasing used to interact with the bot, and then use tht to improve the bot

a seperate instance can be used to turn player numbers into appropriate phrasing
    this can be used to make the bot more human like and have it seem more like whatever character it is

instead of immediately asking the bot for an official response, it could first be asked who it is thinking about investigating/executing to allow players to try to pursuade the bot to change its mind.
    this could also be on a randomizer, so sometimes it listens to people pursuading it.
        instead of a randomizer it could be asked if it wants to make a decision or listen to people pursuading it



is it possible to text the bot using a telegram bot?
    a wireless microphone that can be passed around to talk to the bot may be better. Ideally there would be a way to tell the bot who is talking to it. The data inputter could just always tell it before someone talks, or it could be on the player to introduce themself.
        For this we need a good voice to text api.

a text to voice api could be used to make the bot talk to the players

make a new file that holds the initial prompt, load that into the main loop
maybe make something special if the bot is player 1
