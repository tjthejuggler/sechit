Right now the bot is asked if there is something they want to say every time the user is asked something
    it could be random when it gets asked at that point
    it could only ask in certain situations

move some stuff from main into other files to clean up code

GAME BOT MAKES SUMMARIES FOR CONVERSATION BOT       
    the game version of the bot makes summaries of the game and the talking bot sees those summaries,
        and vice versa, the talking bot makes summaries of the conversations for their later selves, as well as for the game bot.
    
    how often should summaries be made?

HUMAN TALK
    there can be player question limits so that each person gets a certain number of interactions

BOT PERSONNESS:        
    bot could randomly choose its name and a short bio, and introduce itself

    a seperate instance can be used to turn player numbers into appropriate phrasing
        this can be used to make the bot more human like and have it seem more like whatever character it is

    is there a way that the bot could have a face with a mouth that moves to the words? 
        the face could be randomly generated

    we can use stable diffusion and various amounts of mouth openness somehow programatically

bot should tell user to show cards?

figure out a way to make a testbench for this

NEEDS TESTED:
    all powers
    game history creation

HISTORY SAVING:
    keep a running token size for the game summary
    keep track of token sent/received count for entire game

BOT TALK:
    everything that goes through make_bot_response() could be ran through a seperate instance of gpt with the information about the bot to make it more realistic

RANDOM BOT COMMENT:
    when we have been at a cetrain point in the game for awhile, there can be a randomizer that sometimes asks the bot if they want to say something out loud, and tell them how long we have been at this stage. It can tell them to answer yes or no, if they answer yes then it will ask them what they want to say.

BOT DECISIONS
    instead of immediately asking the bot for an official response, it could first be asked who it is thinking about investigating/executing to allow players to try to pursuade the bot to change its mind.
        this could also be on a randomizer, so sometimes it listens to people pursuading it.
            instead of a randomizer it could be asked if it wants to make a decision or listen to people pursuading it

MIC COMMUNICATION
    if someone mentions the name of the bot, then the bot will respond to that person
    
    what if we transcribe everything, pick out the words that are most common and feed those to the bot, what if we transcribe everything, pick out the words that are most common and feed those to the bot, 
    
    it responds to its name, which gets detected without him knowing, and causes an event to happen, he gets notified of the event and can respond to it
    also "everyone" should be a name that has a chance of being triggered by.
        this can be done by privately asking hiim if he has anything he would like to stay

    it can be fed a constant feed of what everyone is saying, even if it is too long, it just needs to be told the game state before it makes decisions. In the information it gets, it can be given description of what has been talked about.
    
    there can be a timer setup, after the bot has said something, if anything is said soon enough after then it will go to the bot to respond to again,
    but after enough time has gone by
