assign a player # to G or randomly pick the first player of the game and make G always be player 1


questions:
what is differnce chatgpt turbo and 301?


thoughts:
only contact G when it needs to make a decision







make a new file that holds the initial prompt, load that into the main loop
maybe make something special if the bot is player 1
