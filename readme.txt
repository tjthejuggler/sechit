I am on ubuntu and I got this error: If you are on Ubuntu or Debian, install libgtk2.0-dev and pkg-config, then re-run cmake or configure script in function 'cvShowImage'

This error message suggests that you are missing some dependencies required by OpenCV, specifically the libgtk2.0-dev and pkg-config packages.

To fix this, you can use the following command to install them:



sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev pkg-config

After installing these packages, try running your Python code again and see if the error has been resolved.

I ran the sudo apt-get install you said to, but I am still getting this: error: (-2:Unspecified error) The function is not implemented. Rebuild the library with Windows, GTK+ 2.x or Cocoa support. If you are on Ubuntu or Debian, install libgtk2.0-dev and pkg-config, then re-run cmake or configure script in function 'cvShowImage'

The error message you're seeing suggests that there may still be some missing dependencies required by OpenCV on your system.

In addition to libgtk2.0-dev and pkg-config, you may also need to install libsm6, libxrender1, and libfontconfig1. These packages are required for displaying images using OpenCV on Ubuntu.

You can install these packages using the following command:

sudo apt-get install libsm6 libxrender1 libfontconfig1

After installing these packages, try running your Python code again and see if the error has been resolved. If you're still having issues, you may need to rebuild OpenCV with the necessary dependencies enabled.

that install didn't do anything, and I am still getting the same error

If installing the required packages didn't resolve the issue, it's possible that you may need to rebuild OpenCV with the necessary dependencies enabled.

To rebuild OpenCV with GTK+ 2.x support, you can follow these steps:

    Uninstall any previous installations of OpenCV using the following command:    

sudo apt-get remove opencv*

Install the necessary dependencies:

sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake git libgtk2.0-dev pkg-config libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev

Clone the OpenCV source code from the official GitHub repository:


git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git

Change to the opencv directory:


cd opencv

Create a build directory and change to it:


mkdir build
cd build

Run CMake to configure the build with the necessary options:

javascript

cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local -D WITH_GTK_2_X=ON ..

Note: The -D WITH_GTK_2_X=ON option enables GTK+ 2.x support.

Build and install OpenCV:

go

    make
    sudo make install

    Note: This will install OpenCV system-wide, so you may need to run sudo ldconfig to update the shared library cache.

After following these steps, try running your Python code again and see if the error has been resolved.


THIS IS WHAT FINALLY GOT OPENCV WORKING FOR message


    sudo apt install libgtk2.0-dev pkg-config as the prompt says for Ubuntu users -> [Same Error]
    pip uninstall opencv-python-headless -> [Other Error]
    pip uninstall opencv-python; pip install opencv-python -> [Solved]
